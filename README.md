Watching Youtube videos I stumbled across with a video where someone re-designed the complete Steam UI, and I loved it!  
In fact, I liked it so much, that I decided to make it real, it's still under development.

## Configuration

The first thing you should do is clone the repository like so:

`git clone https://github.com/pedrolampo/proyecto-react.git`

Then add all the dependencies with:

`npm i`

This will add:

- React
- React-dom and React-router-dom
- React Bootstrap
- React Select
- React-scripts
- uuid-v4

## Setting up Firebase

In the future, this app will include Firebase as a host for it's DB. In the mean time, it's all hard coded for development purposes.

## Running the application

To start the application just run the npm command:

`npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.  
It would automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on the browser and load it.

The page will reload if you make any edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
